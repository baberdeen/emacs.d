gather.el provides search regexp and kill text.  This is not replacing
nor modifying Emacs `kill-ring' mechanism.  You MUST know about elisp
regular-expression.
Have similar concept of `occur'.  If I think `occur' have line oriented
feature, gather.el have list oriented feature.  You can handle the list,
as long as you can handle Emacs-Lisp list object.
