This package provides the M-x vlf command, which visits part of a
large file without loading the entire file.
The buffer uses VLF mode, which defines several commands for
moving around, searching and editing selected part of file.

This package was inspired by a snippet posted by Kevin Rodgers,
showing how to use `insert-file-contents' to extract part of a
file.
